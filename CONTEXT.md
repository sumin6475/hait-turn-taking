# HAIT

A three-participant group task in which two people and an AI participant choose
the best of four candidates for a job. The information needed to choose correctly
is split across the three of them, so the interesting behaviour is conversational:
who says what, when, and whether the group ever assembles the whole picture.

This is the project's vocabulary. It is a glossary and nothing else — no
decisions, no status, no design. Where two words compete for one idea, the one
listed is the one to use.

## Language

### The task

**Candidate**:
One of the four people the group is choosing between, named A, B, C and D. Those
four letters name candidates and nothing else — never a participant, and never
the AI.
_Avoid_: option, applicant, choice

**Trait**:
One statement about one candidate, counting either for or against them. Forty
exist and the set never grows; every trait a participant can hold is one of them.
_Avoid_: attribute, item, point, fact

**Match / Miss**:
A trait that counts for a candidate, or against. Every match and every miss
weighs the same — the task has no quality that outranks another, and treating one
as decisive is an error the group can make.
_Avoid_: pro/con, positive/negative, strength/weakness

**Profile**:
The subset of the forty traits one participant can see — their card. Three exist,
called X, Y and Z, and every participant is dealt exactly one.

**Hidden profile**:
The task's design, in which no single profile contains enough to identify the
best candidate. The group can only get it right by pooling, which is what makes
the conversation, rather than any individual's judgement, the thing under study.

**Pooled answer**:
The candidate the group should choose once every profile's traits are in view. It
is deliberately not the candidate any single profile favours, and it is not
recorded here — Alex must reach it the way a participant would.

**Alex**:
The AI participant. It is dealt profile Z, and it is a participant with a name,
not a tool the humans operate.
_Avoid_: the bot, the assistant, the agent, the AI

### What is in view

**Surfaced**:
A trait that has been said aloud by anyone, Alex included. Its only legitimate
use is avoiding repetition — it says a thing was mentioned, not that the group
took it up.

**Confirmed**:
A trait a human participant put in view. This is the group's shared knowledge,
and it is the set to reason from when asking what the group actually knows.

**Known**:
Everything Alex may legitimately draw on: its own profile, plus everything
surfaced or confirmed. Wider than what Alex was dealt, narrower than the full
forty.

**Board**:
What the group has collectively put in view, candidate by candidate. Participants
say "on the table" and mean this; the word table means a layout everywhere else,
so prefer board when writing.

**Coverage**:
How many distinct traits for one candidate are on the board, matches and misses
together. It says how much of a candidate the group has looked at, never how well
that candidate is doing.

**Score**:
Matches minus misses on the board for one candidate. Every trait weighs the same,
so this is a count and not a verdict, and no participant ever hears one. While
the board holds mostly shared traits it ranks the candidates backwards, which is
why it never decides what the group works on next.

**Live list**:
The candidates the group has not yet pooled anything about, recomputed from the
board every turn. A candidate leaves the list when a human has put something
about it on the board that Alex does not hold — one trait off a participant's own
card is enough, and nothing Alex says moves it, because Alex saying its own card
tells the leader nothing about what the group still has to give. Leaving means Alex stops steering toward that
candidate and stops volunteering information about it — Alex still answers
questions about it, and it is removed from nobody's choice. The list says where
attention is still owed, never which candidate is winning.
_Avoid_: shortlist, elimination, ranking

### The conversation

**Thread**:
A stretch of conversation pursuing one goal with one requested action. A session
usually has one, and a new one begins when the group changes what it is trying to
do.

**Opportunity**:
A specific opening for Alex to speak, derived from something a participant said.
It is a candidate for speech and never an entitlement — most are never taken.
_Avoid_: obligation, cue, trigger

**Kind**:
What sort of opening an opportunity is: a direct question, an invitation, a
request to the group, or an uptake of something Alex just said.

**Request**:
The kinds where somebody actually asked Alex for something — a direct question,
an invitation, or a request to the group. A request stays takeable until it is
answered or retired, because nobody stops waiting for an answer just because
somebody else spoke next. An uptake is not a request: nobody asked, and it lasts
only while the reply that minted it is the current message.
_Avoid_: prompt, ask

**Expectation**:
How strongly an opportunity calls for an answer: required, invited, or optional.
A direct question is the only thing that makes an answer required.

**Consumed**:
What an opportunity becomes when Alex successfully broadcasts a message answering
it. A successful broadcast is the only thing that consumes one — a failed
generation, a blocked floor, or a cancelled turn all leave it open.

**Superseded**:
What an opportunity or a turn becomes when a newer message overtakes it before it
was answered. Distinct from Alex choosing not to answer, and distinct from
failure.

**Expired**:
What an opportunity becomes when it has been open too long without being taken.
Direct questions and required expectations never expire.

**Floor**:
Who the conversation expects to speak next. It is open when nobody in particular
is expected.

**Human floor**:
A floor held by a named human, which Alex must not take. Silence while it is held
is Alex waiting its turn, never Alex having nothing to say.

**Cooldown**:
A minimum number of human messages between Alex's turns, counted deterministically
from the transcript. Silence caused by it is a pacing decision, not a judgement
about content.

**Salience**:
The most recent message at which each candidate was named, kept for the thread.
This is what ranks a candidate's claim on Alex's attention, because it is
deterministic and always defined.

**Focus**:
The single candidate the Observer judges the conversation to be about. It is
absent exactly when it would matter most — a comparison names two candidates and
a continuation names none — so it is a hint, never a ranking.
_Avoid_: using focus where salience is meant

**Seq**:
A message's position in the session, counting from the first. Every claim about
evidence names the seqs it rests on.

### The turn

**Observer**:
The stage that reads the newest human message and reports what it sees about
addressees, threading, the floor, and Alex's relation to what was said. It
proposes; it never decides.

**Ledger**:
The deterministic reducer that owns threads, opportunities and the floor. It is
the authority on conversational state, and it accepts or rejects what the Observer
proposes.

**Judge**:
The stage that decides whether Alex speaks this turn, and on what grounds.

**Router**:
The stage that applies deterministic vetoes — cooldown, the floor, lifecycle —
after the Judge has decided. A veto here is why Alex can be silent on a turn it
judged worth speaking on.

**Route**:
The shape of a turn: answering someone, following up, building on the discussion,
mediating, greeting, summarising, closing, filling a long silence, or
backchannelling. The route decides what kind of move Alex makes, not what it says.

**Broadcast**:
Sending Alex's message to the room. It is the moment a turn becomes real, and
several rules key on it rather than on generation succeeding.

### What Alex may say

**Request scope**:
How much a participant asked for — one trait, one candidate's complete list, the
whole board, a preference, a count. Read from the message itself.
_Avoid_: bare "scope", which is ambiguous between this and the reveal budget

**Reveal budget**:
Retired. It was how many traits Alex could introduce, and how many already-said
ones it could repeat, in a single message. ADR 0010 replaced it with the facts the
Judge names for the turn; the word survives in older issues and session records.
_Avoid_: bare "scope"

**Output scope guard**:
The check made against what was generated, before it is broadcast: nothing
outside the facts the Judge named. It fails closed — a message that breaks it
costs the turn rather than going out.

### The manipulation

**Condition**:
One of the four assignments participants are randomised to, crossing Alex's status
with how it explains itself. A fifth, control, has no AI participant.

**Chair / Member**:
Alex's status within the group, and one of the two manipulated variables. A Chair
may structure the discussion, set the agenda, and mediate; a Member contributes as
an equal and does none of those. These are the names participants
actually see: Alex is rendered in the chat as "Alex — Chair" or "Alex — Member",
and the experiment instructions frame the role the same way.
_Note_: the codebase says leader and peer for the same distinction — in types, in
function names, and in the condition prompts — and that is deliberate, not drift.
Chair and Member are the participant-facing layer; leader and peer are the
internal one. Use whichever layer you are in, and never introduce a third pair.

**Communication strategy**:
The second manipulated variable. Under one strategy Alex compares candidates and
explains why one is stronger; under the other it shares its own information and
asks questions to draw out what the humans hold. The two differ in what Alex
decides to do, not only in how it words things.

**Condition orthogonality**:
The property that conditions differ only in what is being manipulated, and in
nothing else. It is the one thing every change must preserve — a Peer that gains
a Leader's behaviour makes the comparison meaningless, whatever else improves.
