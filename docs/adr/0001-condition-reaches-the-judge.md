# The condition reaches the Judge, not only the generator

Until now the Judge was condition-blind by construction — its prompts say so
literally, and forbid it to infer leader/peer or XAI/ACI — so every difference
between conditions was realised at final generation. That made a Chair and a
Member decide identically and merely *say* it differently, which understates the
manipulation: a chair differs in what they decide to do, not only in how they
word it. We inject a role goal into the Judge so the condition reaches the
decision, and accept that the manipulation now sits upstream of generation.

## What this changes about where the manipulation lives

The manipulation was always applied at two layers, and only one of them is code:
participants are given a role framing in the experiment instructions, and Alex is
given a condition-specific system prompt. This decision changes the second layer
only. Before, that layer governed what Alex *said*; now it also governs what Alex
*decides* — which candidates it weighs, which intervention it selects, and how far
it structures the discussion.

The boundary that does not move: authority over the team's final candidate
submission stays with the human participants in every condition. "The AI's
decisions are manipulated" means its internal evaluation and intervention policy,
never the group's outcome.

## Consequences

Two claims about the study need re-examining before the next run, and neither is
ours to settle:

- "The AI's status is manipulated via the system prompt" stays true but is
  incomplete — participant-facing role framing is the other half, and a reader who
  sees only the prompt half will mis-scope the manipulation.
- "The manipulation affects how the AI communicates" becomes too narrow. It now
  affects candidate evaluation and intervention selection as well.

**Amendment, 2026-09-08 — the owner closed this item.** The two claims above were
put to the study's owner along with the further move in
`0007`/`0008`, which puts a decision procedure upstream of generation in the
leader conditions. The owner elected to proceed without revising the
pre-registration or IRB wording, and authorised sessions to run. That is recorded
here rather than dropped, because this section is what a later reader will use to
learn whether the descriptions were revisited; the answer is that they were
raised and deliberately left as they stand.

One narrower commitment is **not** covered by that and still stands on its own:
if the leader's one-per-session defence of the weakest candidate ships, the
pre-registration must name it as part of the definition of Chair status, because
it is a debiasing treatment bundled into the status condition. See
`.scratch/leader-decision-frame/issues/05`.

**One part of the originating gate must not ship as designed.** That gate also
proposed exposing the cooldown counter to the Judge as a budget it can see and
spend. Combined with this decision, that would make *when* Alex intervenes depend
on the condition — and intervention triggers and timing are explicitly held
constant across conditions. Cooldown and the floor delays are condition-invariant
arithmetic today, and must stay so. The Judge may be given something real to
decide, but it must be *which act on what grounds*, never *when*.

A weaker version of that constraint is already strained and should be stated
rather than discovered: three routes exist only in the Chair conditions, so
"identical triggers" holds of the shared routes and not of mediation, summary and
closing.

**Found while implementing this, and it belongs here rather than in a commit
message.** Once the role goal reaches the Judge, a Chair and a Member can differ
on *whether* Alex speaks at all on a given turn — a Chair may find a mediating
move where a Member finds nothing worth saying. That is not a timing rule reading
the condition, and no timing rule does: the cooldown, the floor, the route delays
and the gates are identical arithmetic in every condition. But it does mean the
claim to defend is the precise one — **no rule about when Alex may speak reads
the condition** — and not the looser one that Alex speaks on the same turns in
every condition. The looser claim was never true anyway, because of the three
Chair-only routes above; it is now false for a second reason, by design.

## Considered and rejected

Leaving the invariant in place. It keeps the cleanest possible separation, but it
buys that cleanliness by making the manipulation weaker than the construct it
claims to manipulate. Every silence measured so far has been the router's
cooldown veto applied *after* the Judge had already decided to contribute, so the
Judge as built decides almost nothing; keeping it condition-blind preserves a
separation that is not doing any work.

## Binding regardless

A Member never gains mediation or task-standard correction. The orthogonality
assertions in the intervention test suite enforce this and must keep passing
unchanged. Note that these are the assertions covering peer/leader prompt
separation and the peer task-drift refusal; an earlier note in the repair
checkpoint cited a line number that no longer points at them, which is why this
ADR names the property rather than a location.
