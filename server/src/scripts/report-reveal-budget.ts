/**
 * [Issue 25] How often a delivered message broke the bound its turn was given,
 * per session and per condition.
 *
 * The reveal budget is what keeps Alex's disclosure rate comparable across
 * conditions, so a breach of it is a threat to the one property every change
 * has to preserve. It was never counted, because until this issue the turn left
 * behind only the guard's pre-broadcast evidence — there was nothing to compare
 * the delivered message against.
 *
 * Trait ids and counts only. No message content and no participant text is read
 * or printed here; session exports are where transcripts live.
