 * count — and the guard's failure mode is precisely an empty extraction reading
 * as "this message revealed nothing". Pinning the set means a change that pushes
 * more phrases into it has to say so.
 *
 * All four here are correct: each is a bare noun phrase carrying no assertion of
 * the negative the trait states. "memory for numbers" is not "below-average
 * memory for numbers"; "verbally skillful" is not "not verbally skillful".
