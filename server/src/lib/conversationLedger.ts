 * Whether an open opportunity is still one of this turn's options, or has

 * [Issue 13B] There used to be one rule for every `invited` expectation: its
 * evidence must include the current trigger. That made an invited opportunity
 * answerable during exactly one turn. Miss that turn for any reason — the
 * cooldown, a held floor, a Judge that chose otherwise — and the request became
 * unreachable while `state.opportunities` went on reporting it open. At
 * T-C2-045 `opp:17` was never selectable on any turn at all: cooldown filtered
 * it on the seq it was current, and this rule filtered it on every seq after.
 *
 * Two populations were sharing that rule, and only one of them is momentary.
 *
 * A **request** — `invitation` or `group_request` — is somebody asking Alex for
 * something. It is an obligation, and an obligation does not stop existing
 * because the next message was somebody else's. It stays takeable until it is
 * answered or the reducer retires it, which it does three ways: the thread
 * closes, Alex answers on the thread and supersedes the older ones, or the
 * [B4] TTL expires it. All three are seq arithmetic already in the reducer, so
 * nothing here needs a second staleness rule.
 *
 * An **uptake** is not a request. Nobody asked; it is minted because a human
 * just replied to Alex, and it licenses Alex to carry that reply one step
 * further. The licence is the reply being fresh. Left standing for the TTL it
 * would become an unconditional right to speak on every turn, which is the
 * thing the cadence invariant exists to prevent — so for an uptake the
 * current-trigger requirement is not staleness bookkeeping, it is the whole
 * meaning of the opportunity, and it stays.
 *
 * `required` expectations were never subject to the rule and are untouched: the
 * uptake branch mints `invited` unconditionally, so a required opportunity is
 * never an uptake and always takes the first return. Testing the expectation
 * here as well read as a second safeguard and was the opposite — it would have
 * silently disabled the uptake rule for the one case it exists to cover.
 *
 * The Judge's prompt, its validation and `deterministicVetoBeforeJudge` all
 * read this one function, so the three can never disagree about what was on
 * offer. They used to state the rule separately in two places.

 * moody is not something you can neglect when lives are at stake, and the turn
 * minted an invitation. The Judge must then say what the request wants, so the

 * Five turns across two sessions were built on a request nobody made

 * quietly dropped or repaired the false half, because it is handed the source
 * utterance and not the brief alone. The wording survived; the decision did not.
 *
 * The cost is the act. A listed request outranks every voluntary act, so while
 * one stands Alex cannot take up what the humans just said. At T-C2-051 seq 22 a
 * participant argued that A's danger-recognition matches B's composure, and the
