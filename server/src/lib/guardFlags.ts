/**
 * Guards that can be switched off for a comparison run.
 *
 * Every flag here silences something that changes what a turn may be — four of
 * them a check that can cost Alex a turn, and the last two a reading that
 * decides what the turn is for. They exist so a
 * session can be run twice — once with a check on, once with it off — and the
 * two transcripts compared, instead of arguing from one session about whether a
 * check earns its cost. T-C4-023 lost seven of twenty-nine turns to four
 * different vetoes; which of them matter is a measurement, not an opinion.
 *
 * Two rules make this safe to keep in the tree.
 *
 * Every flag defaults to ON. An unset environment variable, a typo, and a
 * missing `.env` all produce the shipped behaviour, so a comparison run has to
 * be asked for explicitly and can never happen by accident.
 *
 * Whatever was off is written into the intervention record. A transcript produced
 * with a check disabled and no note of it is worse than no transcript, because
 * it reads exactly like a normal one — so `disabledGuards()` is the default of every
 * intervention row's `disabledGuards` field and the reader can always see which
 * build spoke.
