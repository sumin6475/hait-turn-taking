# Leader decision frame

**What this is.** The design agreed for manipulating Alex's status as *ownership
of a decision procedure* rather than as tone, speaking volume, or the right to
the last word. It replaces the four-stage state machine of the original
"Leader-only Decision Protocol (A-E-S)" proposal with the part of it that
survived scrutiny: a per-turn frame the leader reasons inside, and the peer does
not have.

**What it is not.** It is not a status board and it is not a decision record. A
decision that is settled belongs in `docs/adr/`; open work belongs in
`issues/`.

## Why the original proposal changed shape

Three of its clauses contradicted constraints the study already holds, and one
was aimed at behaviour that has never been observed.

| Original clause | Why it did not survive |
| --- | --- |
| Leader speaks on Judge stage transitions | Intervention triggers and timing are held constant across conditions (`docs/adr/0001`). A stage transition that mints a turn makes that false. |
| Peer's Judge is read-blocked from the evidence board | Alex's held information is fixed across conditions, and `CONTEXT.md` defines **Known** condition-invariantly. Blocking a read also makes the peer answer board questions wrongly, which the answer-quality bar forbids. |
| Peer may not intervene on long silence | Removes a speaking trigger from one condition. Empirically backwards: in T-C3-003 the peer's silence was read by participants as a fault ("AI Alex took a break"). |
| Generator becomes a server-fixed template with slots | The measured gain from T-C2-043 → T-C2-045 came from post-conditions on model output, not from templating. Server guards are now the largest single source of lost turns. |

A frequency count across all available evidence (15 analysed sessions, 21 repair
issues, and the 39-session pre-repair export) found **zero observations of any
leader-side behaviour failing.** Not because leaders behave well, but because no
Chair session has ever run to completion on an analysed build and no aci session
had ever been analysed at all. That is why issue 01 comes before everything else.

## The fixed points

**Nothing here may move `when` Alex speaks.** Cooldown, floor delays, route
delays and lifecycle gates stay condition-invariant arithmetic. The frame
changes *what Alex does on a turn it already qualifies for*, never whether the
turn exists. No new route is added; the nine in `RouteKind` are the whole set.

**Both conditions see the same board.** The peer is not made ignorant. It is made
**passive**. An occasional peer tally is accepted rather than guarded — see
issue 06 for what is actually held apart.

**Authority over the team's final submission stays with the humans**, unchanged.

## The computation

Deterministic, recomputed every turn, no model call. Derived from the board —
what has actually been put in view — so Alex's own unspoken profile Z cannot
steer it. `poolingTally.ts` already computes on exactly this basis.

- `coverage(X)` — distinct traits on the board for candidate X, matches and
  misses together, human-surfaced ∪ Alex-surfaced.
- `score(X)` — matches minus misses on the board for X. Recorded, and **not an
  input to the list**.
- **X leaves the live list when `coverage(X) >= 5`, and for no other reason.**
  > Outdated (2026-09-13): ADR 0011 replaced coverage with pooling — X leaves once
  > a human has put something of their own about X on the board.

Five is derived, not chosen. Every candidate carries exactly four traits that all
three profiles can see, so coverage 4 can be reached on nothing the group did not
already share; five is the first coverage at which something beyond the common
pool must have reached the board.

**The list measures attention, not merit.** An earlier version removed a
candidate for being well covered and clearly trailing on `score`, and `docs/adr/
0009` withdraws that: over a shared-dominated board `score` ranks the candidates
backwards — the three wrong candidates at +4 and the pooled answer at −2 — so any
threshold on it eliminates the right answer at the moment the group has pooled
its common ground and nothing else. `DEPTH_MIN_PER_CAND` (3) keeps its existing
and adjacent job: holding the discussion on a candidate that is still thin.

**"Leaving the list" means only this:** Alex stops steering discussion toward
that candidate and stops volunteering new information about it. Alex still
answers questions about it. It is not removed from anyone's choice.

**The bar is still unvalidated as a bar.** It is derived rather than guessed, but
whether one unshared trait is enough attention is a question only a session
answers. Issue 02 therefore computes and logs the list without letting it reach
speech, and issue 03 does not start until a real session has been read against
it. The failure mode has changed direction: too low a bar costs a nudge not
given, where the withdrawn rule cost the answer.

## What splits the conditions

| | Leader | Peer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Receives the live candidate list | yes | **no** — board only |
| Names a candidate the group has not covered | yes | no |
| Says the group has pooled something about a candidate | yes, without numbers | no |
| Raises a coverage shortfall when the group moves to narrow or to close | once each, then accepts | no |
| Re-argues the weakest candidate once | yes, introducing no new trait | no |
| Uptake attaches to | content **and** the group's procedural move | content only |
| Long silence | may fill | **may also fill** |

The last row is deliberate. The conditions differ in what breaks a silence, not
in whether one may be broken.

## Where it lives

Deterministic state is injected as one identical block into both the Judge and
the generator. *What may be done* goes in the Judge's role goal; *how it is said*
goes in the route prompts. The 30-key snapshot structure, its startup hash
verification, and the orthogonality assertions in `test-intervention-v2` are
untouched.

## The late half of the discussion is not designed

Issue 04's first move — naming a candidate the group has not covered — was built
on 2026-09-10 and reaches the leader's Judge. It answers the early and middle of
a discussion. **Nothing answers the end of one**, and the three pieces that would
have to answer it do not know about each other.

**The Observer already labels the phase.** `conversationPhase` carries one of
`opening / exploration / comparison / deliberation / decision / closing` on every
observation. **No code reads it.** T-C4-024 and T-C2-049 both sat on
`exploration` for their whole length, so the field has never been checked against
a session either.

> **Outdated (2026-09-14).** The next two paragraphs describe the summary timer ADR
> 0012 removed (the Chair now recaps as a Judge act) and a coverage note ADR 0011
> rewrote. The narrowing signal this section calls missing now exists: the Judge is
> told what the group narrowed to.

**The summary arms once, on five thresholds, and changes nothing after it fires.**
`armSummaryIfEligible` needs 10 minutes elapsed, 12 human messages, 8 traits on
the board, 2 candidates covered, and 5 minutes still left. That is the only "the
discussion is late" signal in the server, and all it does is force one turn onto
the summary route. T-C4-024 ended with `summaryStatus: "pending"` and nothing
downstream that a summary having happened would change.

**The coverage note goes quiet exactly when the group starts converging.** When
`live` empties, the leader's Judge is told "there is no coverage gap to name" —
which is the empty slot that produced the invented stopping rule, returning at
the other end of the session. The instruction beside it ("say what the turn adds
to the comparison the group is already having") is markedly vaguer than the one
it replaces ("bring A into the discussion").

Observed, not predicted: **T-C2-049 seq 26-31.** Two participants narrowed to A
and B and asked Alex to help decide; Alex answered by putting one further miss
for B on the table. Nothing told the Judge the group was converging, because
nothing computes that.

### What a design would have to settle

- **When is it late?** `live.length === 0` is available now; elapsed time is
  already read by the summary arming; `summaryStatus === "done"` is recorded. The
  one signal that does not exist is *the humans have narrowed to a subset* — the
  ledger holds `focusCandidate` per turn but nothing derives a narrowing.
- **What does the leader do then?** Issue 04's remaining two moves cover part of
  it: saying what the team has pooled, and raising a coverage shortfall once when
  the group moves to narrow or close. **Moving the group toward a decision is not
  in this spec at all.** Adding it is adding a treatment, and has to be declared
  as one the way issue 05 is.
- **What must not move.** The same fixed points as everything else here: no
  change to when Alex speaks, and the peer receives none of it.

**Ask Sumin before building any of it.** "Moving the group toward a decision" is
a treatment, and whether to add it is not a call to make from the code. The
question to put, in these terms: *the Chair's role goal already says "guide the
group toward a well-considered collective decision", but no move implements it —
do we build moves for it and declare it as a treatment the way issue 05 is
declared, or do we leave the goal without moves and let the Chair's difference
stay in what it says rather than in what it does?* Raised 2026-09-12 and deferred
to the session after T-C2-052.

The empty slot is observable: T-C2-051 seq 41 and 34 read "state a clear ranking
or pick between A and B now". With no facts left and a goal to reach a decision,
an imperative is the only move the design leaves.

**Not scheduled.** No session has yet run long past `live` emptying, so the late
gap is derived from the shape of the code rather than from an observed failure.
Measure it first: on the next session, read what Alex does on the turns after the
list empties.

## Deliberately deferred

- **The repeated question form.** In T-C3-003, 12 of Alex's 15 messages ended
  with the same "Does that match what you have for X?" frame. Fixing it now would
  mix with the frame's own effect. Measured from issue 01 onward; opened as work
  only if it recurs.
- **Loosening the restated-trait bound to fire only on a message with no new
  information.** Issue 17 of the repair records two wrong fixes at this exact
  spot. Issues 18 and 20 changed the input it was reacting to; whether it still
  bites is a question for issue 01's sessions. (Moot: `docs/adr/0010` removed the
  bound, 2026-09-14.)
