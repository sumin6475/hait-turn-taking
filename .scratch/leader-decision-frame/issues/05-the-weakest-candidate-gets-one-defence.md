# 05: The weakest candidate gets one defence, and it brings nothing new

**What to build:** Once per session, after the list has narrowed and before the
close, the leader re-argues the weakest live candidate from what is already on
the board.

**Blocked by:** 04.

**Status:** needs-triage

## This is a treatment, and it is being declared as one

Naming a candidate the group skipped is discussion management. Deliberately
arguing for the option the group has moved away from is **confirmation-bias
correction** — a debiasing intervention studied in its own right. Granting it to
the Chair conditions means the Chair condition is "a higher-status AI **that also
runs a debiasing step**", and any accuracy difference is attributable to either.

That is acceptable if, and only if, it is declared: the re-argument is part of
the definition of Chair status in this study, not an incidental feature of the
implementation. Pre-registration must say so. If it cannot say so, this issue
does not ship and the design stops at issue 04.

## The constraint that keeps it procedural

**The defence introduces no new trait.** It re-argues from what is already on the
board. Without this, the Chair conditions also release more information than the
Member conditions, and the manipulation is no longer status alone — it is status
plus information volume, on the very DV that measures information.

Once per session. After narrowing, before the close.

## Why this move still reads `score` when the list no longer does

`docs/adr/0009` took `score` out of the candidate list because a
shared-dominated board ranks the candidates backwards — the pooled answer looks
worst. This move is the one place that inversion is useful: the candidate that
looks weakest on such a board is the one the group is about to lose, and arguing
for it is exactly the debiasing step this issue declares itself to be.

The same fact makes the direction load-bearing. Defending the apparent loser is
safe; eliminating it is what `0009` withdrew. This issue may read `score` to
choose who to defend, and may never read it to choose who to drop.

## What must not regress

- `discloseTraitIds` for this turn is empty; a non-empty one fails the turn
- Exactly one occurrence per session, recorded whether or not it fired
- The group may ignore it entirely; Alex accepts and proceeds to close
- No peer condition has any path to it

- [ ] The defence turn introduces zero new traits, enforced not requested
- [ ] It fires at most once, and the record shows when it did not fire
- [ ] Pre-registration language naming it as part of Chair status exists before any session runs with it enabled
- [ ] Ignoring it leads to a normal close
